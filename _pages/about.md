I am a **Hydrogeologist** who loves to **build things**. I bridge the gap between earth science and technology, using code and custom hardware to solve environmental problems.

While my formal background is in [Hydrogeology/Earth Science], I spend my spare time soldering PCBs, writing Python scripts, and prototyping IoT sensors.

## What I Do

*   **Hydrogeology**: Groundwater modeling, field studies, and environmental analysis.
*   **The "Maker" Side**: Designing custom field sensors, automated data loggers, and environmental monitoring systems.
*   **Programming**: Automating data analysis, building visualization tools, and "hacking" together solutions when off-the-shelf software isn't enough.

## Recent Projects

*   **[Date]**: Built a low-cost water level logger using Arduino.
*   **[Date]**: Published research on aquifer recharge.
